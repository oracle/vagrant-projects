# ol9-vagrant

A Vagrant project to automatically build an Oracle Linux 8 virtual machine using either VirtualBox or libvirtd with optional extras including a container runtime.

## Prerequisites

Read the [prerequisites in the top level README](../../README.md#prerequisites) to set up Vagrant with either VirtualBox or KVM

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects`
1. Change into the `vagrant-projects/OracleLinux/8` directory
1. Run `vagrant status` to check Vagrantfile status and possible plugin(s) required
1. Run `vagrant up`
   1. The first time you run this it will provision everything and may take a while. Ensure you have a good internet connection!
   1. The Vagrant file allows for customization.
1. SSH into the VM either by using `vagrant ssh`
   If required, by Vagrantfile you can also setup ssh port forwarding.
1. You can shut down the VM via the usual `vagrant halt` and the start it up again via `vagrant up`.

## Optional plugins

When installed, this Vagrant project will make use of the following third party Vagrant plugins:

- [vagrant-env](https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env): loads environment
variables from .env files;
- [vagrant-proxyconf](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf): set
proxies in the guest VMs if you need to access the Internet through proxy. See
plugin documentation for the configuration.
- [vagrant-reload](https://github.com/aidanns/vagrant-reload): reload the VM
during provisioning to activate the latest kernel.

To install Vagrant plugins run:

```shell
vagrant plugin install <name>...
```

## Extending the project

This project can easily be extended by running additional scripts during provisioning and optionally expose guest ports on the host.

Environment variables are used to pass the parameters to the Vagrantfile:

- `EXTEND`: comma separated list of extensions.  
   For each specified extension a script named `<extension>.sh` is automatically run during provisioning.  
   Scripts must be located in the `scripts` or `scripts.local` directory.
- `EXPOSE`: comma separated list of ports to expose in the format: `<host port>:<guest port>`

Example: to extend the project with the `container-tools` extension:

- On a Linux or macOS host:  
   `EXTEND=container-tools vagrant up`
- On a Windows host:  
   `set EXTEND=container-tools && vagrant up`

Alternatively, if the `vagrant-env` plugin is installed variables can be defined in the `.env` or `.env.local` files.

Additionally, you can pass parameters to extensions using environment variables having a name starting with the extension name in uppercase followed by an underscore. E.g., for a Linux host:

```shell
EXTEND=my-extension MY_EXTENSION_PARAM=1234 vagrant up
```

## Sample extension

### Container Tools

Installs the **podman**, **buildah**, and **skopeo** [Container Tools](https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/9/relnotes9.0/ol9.0-NewFeaturesandChanges.html#ol-features-containers).

Set in your environment:

```shell
EXTEND=container-tools
```

Within the guest, run **podman** commands, for example `podman run -it oraclelinux:8-slim` to run an Oracle Linux 8 container, or `podman run -ti oraclelinux:9-slim` to run an Oracle Linux 9 container

## Other info

- If you need to, you can connect to the machine via `vagrant ssh`.
- The directory in which the `Vagrantfile` is located is automatically mounted into the guest at `/vagrant` as a shared folder.
