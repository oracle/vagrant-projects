# oracle-18c-vagrant
A vagrant box that provisions Oracle Database automatically, using Vagrant, an Oracle Linux 7 box and a shell script.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/)

## Getting started
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-boxes`
2. Change into the desired version folder
3. Download the installation zip files from OTN into this folder - first time only:
[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html)
4. Run `vagrant up`
   1. The first time you run this it will provision everything and may take a while. Ensure you have (a good) internet connection as the scripts will update the virtual box to the latest via `yum`.
   2. The Vagrant file allows for customization, if desired (see [Customization](#customization))
5. Connect to the database.
6. You can shut down the box via the usual `vagrant halt` and the start it up again via `vagrant up`.
