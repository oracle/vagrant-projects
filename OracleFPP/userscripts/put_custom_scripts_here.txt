Any shell (.sh) or SQL (.sql) scripts you put in this directory
will be executed by the installer after the database is set up
and started.  Only shell and SQL scripts will be executed; 
all other files will be ignored.  
These scripts are completely optional.
Shell scripts will be executed as the vagrant user, which has
sudo privileges.  SQL scripts will be executed as SYS.
To run scripts in a specific order, prefix the file names with a number, 
e.g., 01_shellscript.sh, 02_tablespaces.sql, 03_shellscript2.sh, etc.
