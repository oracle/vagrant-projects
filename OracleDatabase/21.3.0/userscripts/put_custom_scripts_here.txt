Any shell (.sh) or SQL (.sql) scripts you put in this directory
will be executed by the installer after the database is set up
and started.  Only shell and SQL scripts will be executed; all
other files will be ignored.  These scripts are completely
optional.

Shell scripts will be executed as root.  SQL scripts will be
executed as SYS.  SQL scripts will run against the CDB, not the
PDB, unless you include an ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = <pdbname>
statement in the script.

To run scripts in a specific order, prefix the file names with a
number, e.g., 01_shellscript.sh, 02_tablespaces.sql,
03_shellscript2.sh, etc.
